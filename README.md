# Math Notes
This repository contains: 
* Math 455 (Analysis 4, Winter 2020) notes, which will be updated as the semester progresses
* Math 454 (Analysis 3, Fall 2019) final summary, which I made to review for the final
* Math 357 (Statistics, Winter 2020) full class notes, will be delayed since I tex them after lectures
* Math 458 (Differential Geometry, Winter 2020), compilation of various online resources and textbooks. I only use the class notes as a rough outline.  
* Math 133 (Linear Algebra and Geometry, Fall 2017) I lost the .tex file so I cannot fix any typos. 
* Math 141 (Calculus II, Fall 2017) I lost the .tex file so I cannot fix any typos. 
* Math 222 (Calculus III, Winter 2018) I lost the .tex file so I cannot fix any typos.  

The following are long-term projects since they are not classes that are actively happening (roughly in order of priority): 
* Math 248 (Advanced Calculus, Fall 2018) full class notes. 
* Math 247 (Applied Linear Algebra, Winter 2018) full class notes. 
* Math 475 (Partial Differential Eqns, Fall 2019) full class notes, very long-term since I do not need the material for a Winter 2020 class but will need it in Fall of 2020, so these will most likely be finished by September 2020. 
* Math 235 (Algebra 1, Fall 2018), full class notes, also very long-term. Most likely will finish by September 2020 
* Math 254 (Analysis 1, Fall 2018)
