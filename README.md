# Math Notes
This repository contains: 
* Math 455 (Analysis 4, Winter 2020) summary.
* Math 454 (Analysis 3, Fall 2019) summary.
* Math 357 (Statistics, Winter 2020) full notes.
* Math 458 (Differential Geometry, Winter 2020), compilation of various online resources and textbooks. I only use the class notes as a rough outline.  
* Math 133 (Linear Algebra and Geometry, Fall 2017) I lost the .tex file so I cannot fix any typos. 
* Math 141 (Calculus II, Fall 2017) I lost the .tex file so I cannot fix any typos. 
* Math 222 (Calculus III, Winter 2018) I lost the .tex file so I cannot fix any typos.  
* Math 254 (Analysis 1, Fall 2018) summary.
* Math 247 (Applied Linear Algebra, Winter 2018) summary.  
* Math 248 (Vector Calculus / Advanced Calculus, Fall 2018) summary sheet. 

The following are long-term projects since they are not classes that are actively happening (roughly in order of priority): 

* Math 475 (Partial Differential Eqns, Fall 2019) 
* Math 235 (Algebra 1, Fall 2018), full class notes, also very long-term. Most likely will finish by September 2020 
* Math 254 (Analysis 1, Fall 2018)

Some other things.
