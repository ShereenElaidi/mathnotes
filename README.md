# Math Notes
This repository contains: 
* Math 455 (Analysis 4, Winter 2020) summary.
* Math 454 (Analysis 3, Fall 2019) summary.
* Math 357 (Statistics, Winter 2020) full notes.
* Math 458 (Differential Geometry, Winter 2020), compilation of various online resources and textbooks. I only use the class notes as a rough outline.  
* Math 133 (Linear Algebra and Geometry, Fall 2017) I lost the .tex file so I cannot fix any typos. 
* Math 141 (Calculus II, Fall 2017) I lost the .tex file so I cannot fix any typos. 
* Math 222 (Calculus III, Winter 2018) I lost the .tex file so I cannot fix any typos.  
* Math 254 (Analysis 1, Fall 2018) summary.
* Math 247 (Applied Linear Algebra, Winter 2018) summary.  
* Math 248 (Vector Calculus / Advanced Calculus, Fall 2018) summary sheet. 

Work-in-progress:
* Math 466 (Complex Analysis, Fall 2020) full notes.
* Math 456 (Algebra 3, Fall 2020) full notes.
